//// Lustre's Dev Tools is a CLI (Command Line Interface) that provides a set of commands
//// for running and building Lustre projects. If you're familiar with frontend Web
//// development, you could consider the Lustre Dev Tools as something similar to
//// [vite](https://vitejs.dev) but built right into the framework! If you're not
//// familiar with what these tools are used for... then read on.
////
//// > **Note**: currently one of lustre_dev_tools' dependencies is not compatible
//// > with the most recent version of `gleam_json`, making it impossible to install.
//// > To fix this, add `gleam_json = "1.0.1"` as a dependency in your `gleam.toml`
//// > file.
////
//// Lustre Dev Tools is written in Gleam and requires **Erlang** to be installed even
//// if you are only building a JavaScript project. Most methods of installing Gleam
//// will guide you through installing Erlang too, but make sure you have it installed
//// before you try to use the Lustre CLI!
////
//// Because the CLI is written in Gleam, you will run it using the `gleam` command.
//// As an example, starting a development server looks like this:
////
//// ```sh
//// gleam run -m lustre/dev start
//// ```
////
//// <h2 id="add" class="member-name">
////   <a href="#add">lustre/dev add</a>
//// </h2>
////
//// This command lets you install development-specific binaries and tools from outside
//// the Gleam ecosystem. Lustre tries to be smart about the executables it understands:
//// if you try to build a project without esbuild it will grab it, if it finds a
//// tailwind.config.js it will use tailwind, and so on. All binaries are added to
//// `build/.lustre/bin` in case you need to execute them manually.
////
//// ### `lustre/dev add esbuild`
////
//// [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) is a bundler and build tool for JavaScript
//// projects. This is the backbone of a lot of Lustre's build tooling and will be
//// installed automatically if you use `lustre build` or `lustre dev`.
////
//// Example:
////
//// ```sh
//// gleam run -m lustre/dev add esbuild
//// ```
////
//// ### `lustre add tailwind`
////
//// [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first CSS framework popular
//// among devs that want to quickly iterate on designs without touching CSS directly.
//// This will be installed automatically if Lustre detects a `tailwind.config.js` file
//// in your project.
////
//// Example:
////
//// ```sh
//// gleam run -m lustre/dev add tailwind
//// ```
////
//// <h2 id="build" class="member-name">
////   <a href="#build">lustre/dev build</a>
//// </h2>
////
//// Gleam projects can be compiled to JavaScript but this output is not always
//// desirable for frontend projects where many individual modules can cause HTTP
//// bottlenecks and slower load times. The `lustre build` command produces different
//// _bundles_ that are single JavaScript files containing all the code needed for an
//// application to run.
////
//// If a `lustre build` subcommand is run without the necessary tooling installed,
//// Lustre will attempt to install it automatically.
////
//// ### `lustre/dev build app`
////
//// Bundle a Gleam application into a single JavaScript file. This requires a Gleam
//// module in your project with the same name as the project itself, and a public
//// `main` function that will be called when the application starts.
////
//// _This can be any Gleam program_, but if your `main` function returns an
//// `App(Nil, model, msg)` then Lustre will automatically generate some boilerplate
//// to mount the app onto an element with the id `"app"` and start it.
////
//// In addition to bundling, Lustre's dev tools will apply the following
//// transformations to the output:
////
//// - FFI modules will be copied into Gleam's build directory even if they are
////   not directly under the `src/` directory. This is a temporary patch until
////   the Gleam compiler supports this itself.
////
//// - FFI modules that have *relative* imports to `*.gleam` modules will have
////   their imports rewritten to point to the compiled `*.mjs` files instead.
////
//// Flags:
////
//// - `--minify` - Reduce the size of the output bundle by removing whitespace and
////   renaming variables. This is useful for production builds.
////
//// Example:
////
//// ```sh
//// gleam run -m lustre/dev build app
//// ```
////
//// ### `lustre/dev build component`
////
//// Lustre components are based on standard Web Components. This means they should
//// be usable outside of Lustre and Gleam! The `lustre build component` command takes
//// a module and bundles it into a single JavaScript file that can be included in
//// _any_ Web app to register a new Custom Element that can be used like native HTML
//// elements.
////
//// For a module to be bundled as a component, it must adhere to the following rules:
////
//// - There must be a `pub const name` that is a string representing the name of the
////   component to register. Remember that it must always contain a hyphen and follow
////   [these rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define#valid_custom_element_names).
////
//// - There must be a `pub fn` that has the type `fn() -> App(Nil, model, msg)`. It's
////   name is not important but in cases where multiple functions in a module fit this
////   type, the _first_ one will be used.
////
//// In addition to bundling, Lustre's dev tools will apply the following
//// transformations to the output:
////
//// - FFI modules will be copied into Gleam's build directory even if they are
////   not directly under the `src/` directory. This is a temporary patch until
////   the Gleam compiler supports this itself.
////
//// - FFI modules that have *relative* imports to `*.gleam` modules will have
////   their imports rewritten to point to the compiled `*.mjs` files instead.
////
//// Arguments:
////
//// - `<module_path>` - The path to the Lustre component you want to bundle. This should
////   be in the same format that you would write to import the module in a Gleam file,
////   e.g. `ui/my_componnt` and **not** `src/ui/my_component.gleam`.
////
//// Flags:
////
//// - `--minify` - Reduce the size of the output bundle by removing whitespace and
////   renaming variables. This is useful for production builds.
////
//// Example:
////
//// ```sh
//// gleam run -m lustre/dev build component ui/counter
//// ```
////
//// <h2 id="start" class="member-name">
////   <a href="#start">lustre/dev start</a>
//// </h2>
////
//// The `lustre/dev start` command starts a development server that builds and serves your
//// project. This lets you focus on development without having to worry about a backend
//// or additional tooling. The page will automatically reload when you make changes
//// to your project.
////
//// Flags:
////
//// - `--port` - The port to serve the project on. Defaults to `1234`.
////
//// Example:
////
//// ```sh
//// gleam run -m lustre/dev start --port=8080
//// ```
////

//// Lustre Dev Tools is still an experimental work in progress. If you run in to issues
//// or have ideas for how it could be improved we'd love to hear from you, either by
//// [opening an issue](https://github.com/lustre-labs/dev-tools/issues) or reaching out
